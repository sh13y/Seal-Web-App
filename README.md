## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
2. **npm** or **yarn**
3. **yt-dlp** installed and available in PATH

### Installing yt-dlp

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yt-dlp
```

#### On macOS:
```bash
brew install yt-dlp
```

#### On Windows:
Download from [yt-dlp releases](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) and add to PATH.

## Installation

```bash
cd "Seal Web App"
```

2. **Install root dependencies:**

npm install
```

3. **Install all dependencies (root + client):**
```bash
npm run install:all
```

## Development

### Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Backend server on `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend development server on `http://localhost:3000`

### Start servers individually:

**Backend only:**
```bash
npm run server:dev
```

**Frontend only:**
```bash
npm run client:dev
```

## Production

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

For a complete list, run: `yt-dlp --list-extractors`

## Security Considerations

- Input validation for URLs
- File path sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Helmet security headers
- No arbitrary command execution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **yt-dlp not found:**
   - Ensure yt-dlp is installed and in your PATH
   - Test with: `yt-dlp --version`

2. **Permission errors:**
   - Check write permissions for the downloads directory
   - Run with appropriate user permissions

3. **Download failures:**
   - Check if the URL is supported
   - Verify internet connectivity
   - Some sites may require authentication
